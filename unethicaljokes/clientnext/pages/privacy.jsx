                <p className={styles.articleText}>
                    Automatically collected information Our servers automatically collect the following Information regarding devices that access our site or app: device characteristics (including device ID for mobile devices), operating system, browser type, IP address, username from stored cookies if present, dates and times of each login, page and Image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links. We use this automatically collected anonymous data to analyze how our site and app are used so as to keep them optimized, to determine the popularity and usefulness of various features, to maintain the integrity of user accounts so that each user can see his or her posts and the upvotes, downvotes, and comments to them, and to enable users with usernames to access their posts, albums, and membership information. We also use such data to enable us to comply with copyright law, with 18 USC §2258A (illegal content), and to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security, courts, and law enforcement. None of this information is "personal data" — that is, data we could use to Identify a specific person. Some of this information could, however, become personal data because we provide automatically collected anonymous data to third party advertisers to supplement the tracking information described below, and those third parties might be able to combine our anonymous data with other data they have to enable them to identify people.

                    In addition to the automatically collected anonymous data described above, we may place information on your device and then retrieve it later: we may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking Information to improve our server's Interaction with your device. We also partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place and/or recognize cookies on your device that collect data about which pages and ads are viewed while our app or site is being used. Advertiser cookies enable customized ads that are selected for display on your device based on the anonymous Information collected. No personal data is on, connected to, or derivable from, these cookies. If you block or disable cookies and other tracking technologies, instead of getting customized ads you will see non-customized (generic) ads. Although our servers currently don't respond to "do not track" requests, you can block tracking in other ways. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies for interest-based advertising, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or see the section below, "Accessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data". Unethical Jokes has not participated in any digital advertising alliance’s (DM) self-regulatory program for Online Behavioural Advertising.

                    Because we don't collect information about the identity of our users and don't receive any Information from third parties enabling us to identify our users, we have no means of knowing, or providing you with Information about, whatever anonymous data about you we might have on our servers — unless you have a username. If you have a username, you may log In and access your data, correct whatever Information you deem to be incorrect, opt out of information sharing with our advertisers, or delete your account.
